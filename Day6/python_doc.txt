'What is Python?\n',
 'Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants, on the Mac, and on Windows 2000 and later.\n',

 'What is the Python Software Foundation?\n',
 'The Python Software Foundation is an independent non-profit organization that holds the copyright on Python versions 2.1 and newer. The PSFs mission is to advance open source technology related to the Python programming language and to publicize the use of Python. The PSFs home page is at https://www.python.org/psf/.\n',

 'Are there copyright restrictions on the use of Python?\n',
 'You can do anything you want with the source, as long as you leave the copyrights in and display those copyrights in any documentation about Python that you produce. If you honor the copyright rules, its OK to use Python for commercial use, to sell copies of Python in source or binary form (modified or unmodified), or to sell products that incorporate Python in some form. We would still like to know about all commercial use of Python, of course.\n',

 'Why was Python created in the first place?\n',
 'Heres a very brief summary of what started it all, written by Guido van Rossum:\n',
 '\n',
 'I had extensive experience with implementing an interpreted language in the ABC group at CWI, and from working with this group I had learned a lot about language design. This is the origin of many Python features, including the use of indentation for statement grouping and the inclusion of very-high-level data types (although the details are all different in Python).\n',
 '\n',
 'I had a number of gripes about the ABC language, but also liked many of its features. It was impossible to extend the ABC language (or its implementation) to remedy my complaints in fact its lack of extensibility was one of its biggest problems. I had some experience with using Modula-2+ and talked with the designers of Modula-3 and read the Modula-3 report. Modula-3 is the origin of the syntax and semantics used for exceptions, and some other Python features.\n',
 '\n',
 'I was working in the Amoeba distributed operating system group at CWI. We needed a better way to do system administration than by writing either C programs or Bourne shell scripts, since Amoeba had its own system call interface which wasnt easily accessible from the Bourne shell. My experience with error handling in Amoeba made me acutely aware of the importance of exceptions as a programming language feature.\n',
 '\n',
 'It occurred to me that a scripting language with a syntax like ABC but with access to the Amoeba system calls would fill the need. I realized that it would be foolish to write an Amoeba-specific language, so I decided that I needed a language that was generally extensible.\n',
 '\n',
 'During the 1989 Christmas holidays, I had a lot of time on my hand, so I decided to give it a try. During the next year, while still mostly working on it in my own time, Python was used in the Amoeba project with increasing success, and the feedback from colleagues made me add many early improvements.\n',
 '\n',
 'In February 1991, after just over a year of development, I decided to post to USENET. The rest is in the Misc/HISTORY file.\n',
 '\n',
 'What is Python good for?\n',
 'Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems.\n',
 '\n',
 'The language comes with a large standard library that covers areas such as string processing (regular expressions, Unicode, calculating differences between files), Internet protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, XML-RPC, POP, IMAP, CGI programming), software engineering (unit testing, logging, profiling, parsing Python code), and operating system interfaces (system calls, filesystems, TCP/IP sockets). Look at the table of contents for The Python Standard Library to get an idea of whats available. A wide variety of third-party extensions are also available. Consult the Python Package Index to find packages of interest to you.\n',
 '\n',
 'How does the Python version numbering scheme work?\n',
 'Python versions are numbered A.B.C or A.B. A is the major version number  it is only incremented for really major changes in the language. B is the minor version number, incremented for less earth-shattering changes. C is the micro-level  it is incremented for each bugfix release. See PEP 6 for more information about bugfix releases.\n',
 '\n',
 'Not all releases are bugfix releases. In the run-up to a new major release, a series of development releases are made, denoted as alpha, beta, or release candidate. Alphas are early releases in which interfaces arent yet finalized; its not unexpected to see an interface change between two alpha releases. Betas are more stable, preserving existing interfaces but possibly adding new modules, and release candidates are frozen, making no changes except as needed to fix critical bugs.\n',
 '\n',
 'Alpha, beta and release candidate versions have an additional suffix. The suffix for an alpha version is aN for some small number N, the suffix for a beta version is  for some small number N, and the suffix for a release candidate version is cN for some small number N. In other words, all versions labeled 2.0aN precede the versions labeled 2.0bN, which precede versions labeled 2.0cN, and those precede 2.0.\n',
